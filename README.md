# Robot Practice

You can look at the example of the robot.py we have so far.
Ignore the other stuff

### Hopefully we can do some of the following together this season:
  Understand what Python is and how to use it
  
  Deploy the simple code onto our robot and make sure it is working
  
  Start learning how to use a "Command" framework for our next build
  
    This program uses a "Timebase" framework which is easier to understand, 
    because everything is in one file. A Command framework uses multiple 
    smaller files, but make autonomous features a bajilion times easier.
